Bug System Support
==================

test-patch has the ability to support multiple bug systems.  Bug tools have some extra hooks to fetch patches, line-level reporting, and posting a final report. Every bug system plugin must have one line in order to be recognized:

```bash
add_bugsystem <pluginname>
```

* pluginname\_locate\_patch

    - Given input from the user, download the patch if possible.

* pluginname\_determine\_branch

    - Using any heuristics available, return the branch to process, if possible.

* pluginname\_determine\_issue

    - Using any heuristics available, set the issue, bug number, etc, for this bug system, if possible.  This is typically used to fill in supplementary information in the final output table.

* pluginname\_writecomment

    - Given text input, write this output to the bug system as a comment.  NOTE: It is the bug system's responsibility to format appropriately.

* pluginname\_linecomments

    - This function allows for the system to write specific comments on specific lines if the bug system supports code review comments.

* pluginname\_finalreport

    - Write the final result table to the bug system.
